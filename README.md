# Master Thesis Repository

This repository contains the code and models developed for my master thesis as part of the "Data Science and Economics" program. The thesis investigates **"Developing a unifying modeling language to analyze, simulate, and monitor collective dynamics and spreading processes over Multiplex Multi-Layer Networks (MLNs). Inspired by Kappa rule-based formalism and Spatio-Temporal Reach and Escape Logic (STREL), this language aims to address standardization challenges in network science, providing a flexible, intuitive framework for diverse domains including epidemiology, sociology, and technology."**

## Main File

- **`main.ipynb`**: The central Jupyter notebook that executes the primary analyses and workflows described in the thesis. Readers can follow this notebook to replicate the results.

## Reader of the Thesis

To fully understand and utilize this repository, refer to the thesis document **`ParserThesis.py`**. It contains detailed descriptions of the methodology, models, and results.

## Input Files

The repository relies on the following input files and directories:
- **`Language files/`**: Contains [brief description of the language files' purpose].
- **`Network files/`**: Includes network-related data or model files necessary for the analysis.
- **`PRISM models and properties/`**: Includes PRISM model files and properties used for probabilistic model checking.

## Dependencies

The project dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:
- Python libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.
- PRISM Model Checker: [PRISM website](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/)

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb` to execute the primary analyses:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

3. Utilize the input files from the relevant directories to replicate the results.

## Author

This repository was created as part of my master thesis in the "Data Science and Economics" (LM-91) program at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano in collaboration with University of Konstanz.
